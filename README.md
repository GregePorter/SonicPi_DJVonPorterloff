Hello hello hello!

I am DJ Von Porterloff and I'm learning how to use Sonic Pi. 

I thought it might be fun to upload my beats and songs and whatnot to SoundCloud but the tutorial suggests uploading them to Github. 

Feel free to leave a comment or suggestion! And feel free to use these how you see fit but let me know if you do!
